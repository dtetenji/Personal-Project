## Project #1: Analysis of Resistor Values
Concepts explored: functions, for loops, while & do while loops, switch-case.
Functions, and properties used: char(), float(), int().#

This program allows users to input ther resistor values withtin a specified range and is built to range and character proof stray user inputs that are not allowed or in range. it allows user to check for statistical data on resistor values inputed and to re-run the program again once they are done

## Project #2: Exploring Hardware(circuit Board) Implementation of Simon Says Game
Concepts explored: functions, for loops, while & do while loops, switch-case.
Functions, and properties used: char(), float(), int()

The main program is located in sources folder as main.c . This is an implementation of a simon say game for an nxp freedom development board that makes use of a touch slider and pwm led to interface with the user. User has to remeber 
## Project #3: Analyzing Thanksgiving Dinner
Concepts explored: pandas, functions, boolean filtering
