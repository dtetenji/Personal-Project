## Project #1: Analysis of Resistor Values
Concepts explored: functions, for loops, while & do while loops, switch-case.
Functions, and properties used: char(), float(), int().#

This program allows users to input ther resistor values withtin a specified range and is built to range and character proof stray user inputs that are not allowed or in range. it allows user to check for statistical data on resistor values inputed and to re-run the program again once they are done

## Project #2: Exploring Hardware(circuit Board) Implementation of Simon Says Game
Concepts explored: functions, for loops, while & do while loops, switch-case.
Functions, and properties used: char(), float(), int()

The main program is located in sources folder as main.c . This is an implementation of a simon say game for an nxp freedom development board that makes use of a touch slider and pwm led to interface with the user. User has to remeber 

## Project #3: Using Matlab to Model Digital Communication Systems
The Matlab scripts written in this folder were used to model digital modulation techniques for modern communication systems. based on theory an ideal transmitter, channel and receiver is implemented in each code. Simulations are then run for varying signal to noise ratios to see the effect on demodulation and thus ideal efficiencies of the system. C programming knowledge was used to implement the scripts.
